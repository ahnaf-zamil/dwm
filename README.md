# Custom DWM Build

This is my custom [DWM](dwm.suckless.org/) build because I cant be bothered to reinstall my patches and stuff every time I reinstall my OS.

## FAQ

**NO**, I don't change my keybinds. Because I cba to follow tutorials which have a different keybind than me, so I just use the defaults.

I'm using DWM 6.1 btw :D

## Patches Used

- [Vanity Gaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/vanitygaps/) - Cuz gaps increase your swag
- [Autostart](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/) - To run scripts after startup (e.g compositor, wallpaper manager, statusbar, etc.)
- [Tatami](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/tatami/) - Cuz I don't like the normal layout

## Installing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahnaf-zamil/dwm
cd dwm
sudo make clean install
```
